🚀 Project Completed: Full Project Implementation (Task - 4)
📅 Timeline: 9 Days
🧑‍💻 Tech Stack: HTML | CSS | JavaScript

I'm excited to share that I’ve successfully completed Task 4 - Full Project Implementation, where I built three fully functional projects combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🎯 Key Projects Built:

Personal Portfolio Website:
Designed a multi-page responsive website showcasing my skills, projects, and contact info.

To-Do List / Note-Taking App with Local Storage:
Implemented localStorage to ensure data persistence—tasks and notes are now saved and retrieved seamlessly.

Product Listing Page with Filtering & Sorting:
Created a dynamic page where users can filter products by categories or price, and sort them based on ratings.
